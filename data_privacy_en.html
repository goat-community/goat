    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.</p>
    <p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>
    <p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>
    <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
    <p>I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br>II. The rights of users and data subjects<br>III. Information about the data processing</p>
    <h3>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>

    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Elias Pajares</span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Herzogstra&szlig;e 81</span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">80796 M&uuml;nchen</span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Germany</span></p>

    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Elias Pajares&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
    <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right</p>
    <ul type="disc">
    <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);</li>
    <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
    <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;</li>
    <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
    <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
    <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>
    <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
    <p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>

    <h4>Server data</h4>
    <p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.</p>
    <p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>
    <p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security of our website.</p>
    <p>The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.</p>
    <h4>Third party-services</h4>
    <p>Our website includes plugins of the Vimeo video portal by Vimeo, LLC, 555 West 18th Street, New York, New York 10011, USA. 
    Each time you visit a site that offers one or more Vimeo video clips, a direct connection is established between your
    browser and a Vimeo server in the USA. Information about your visit and your IP address is stored there. By interacting
    with the Vimeo plugins (e.g. clicking the start button), this information is also transmitted to Vimeo and stored there.</p>
    <p>If you have a Vimeo account and do not want Vimeo to collect information about you through this website and link to your Vimeo membership information, you must log out of Vimeo before visiting this website. For more information about Vimeo’s collection and use of your information can be found at Vimeo’s Privacy Policy: https://vimeo.com/privacy.</p>
    <p>Vimeo also uses an iFrame to show videos. This iFrame connects to Google Analytics. This is Vimeo’s own tracking system to which we have no access. You can stop tracking by Google Analytics by using the opt-out tools that Google offers for some internet browsers. Users can also prevent Google from collecting data generated by Google Analytics and relating to their use of the website (including their IP address) and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. Further information on Vimeo’s data processing and information on data protection can be found at https://vimeo.com/privacy or https://vimeo.com/cookie_policy.</p>
    <h4>Contact</h4>
    <p>If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide will be used for the purpose of processing your request. We must have this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we will not be able to answer it in full or at all.</p>
    <p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
    <p>Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.</p>
