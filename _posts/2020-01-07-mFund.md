We are very excited to announce the launch of a great new project within the research initiative mFund, that is funded by the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. The aim of the project is to enhance GOAT to include new features such as cycling, scenarios on land-use changes and further enhancements that improve the usability of the application.  

The research initiative mFund supports research and development projects relating to digital data-based applications for mobility 4.0 (more information: [www.mfund.de](http://www.mfund.de)). Within this framework, the Chair for Urban Structure and Transport Planning at the Technical University of Munich has received a one-year funding for the further development of the innovative open-source tool GOAT. The associated project runs until November 2020 and will end with releasing a fully operational version labeled 1.0 of GOAT.

Through close coordination and cooperation in test cycles and workshops with practitioners from the municipalities München, Fürstenfeldbruck and Freising, GOAT will be continuously improved in terms of usability and usefulness and thus adapted to the needs of planners.

So far, the online webtool is only available for Munich. However, within this project, GOAT will also be published for Freising and Fürstenfeldbruck. The three cities are shown in the map below. Munich is the 3rd largest city in Germany and has a population of around 1.5 million. Freising is a town located north of Munich and has 48.634 Inhabitants. Fürstenfeldbruck is a town with 35.494 inhabitants and is located in the west of Munich.

GOAT as open-source accessibility instrument aims to provide a toolbox that helps to properly plan for pedestrians and cyclists. In the course of this project, numerous features will be added. Thus, all accessibility calculations that are currently available for walking will also be provided for cycling. For this purpose, the routing functions will be adjusted and new attributes such as incline and smoothness of the road surface included.

In addition, soon it will be possible to interactively model and evaluate scenarios for land-use changes (e.g. the construction of new residential areas or the opening of a new school). Since good data availability is a prerequisite for every model, a strong focus will also be on fusing different datasets and foster further contribution to the OpenStreetMap project. Furthermore, in the future, it will be easier to upload and use own custom data.

With the newly provided options GOAT aims to serve as useful planning instrument for more efficient and effective transport, land use and mobility planning. We are excited to work on this project and are looking forward to your feedback.
