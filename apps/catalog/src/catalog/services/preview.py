"""A bounded sample of an item's data, read straight from the catalog bucket.

The catalog serves metadata; this is the one endpoint that touches the data
itself, so that a detail page can show *what the dataset looks like* rather
than only what it claims to be -- the map preview a Carto-style catalog page
is built around, and the rows behind it.

**Geometry is optional.** A dataset with geometry samples features; an
attribute table samples rows and gives each a ``null`` geometry -- a Feature
the GeoJSON spec allows, which a client renders as a table and fits no map to.
One response shape for both, because the question a detail page asks ("what
does a record look like") is the same question either way.

Three decisions shape it, each measured against the real bucket rather than
assumed:

**A fixed sample, not a viewport.** No ``bbox`` parameter, no refetch on pan or
zoom. That keeps the response a pure function of (item, mirror generation), so
a client can cache it and a deployment may cache it server-side as well.

**The read is bounded, not scanned.** The sample is the first rows of the
file -- see `_sample_sql`, which is where the cost of this endpoint is decided
and what the alternatives were measured to cost.

**The cap is bytes, not features.** Per-feature GeoJSON across the live catalog
spans 0.07-66.7 KB -- a ~950x range that file size does not predict (the worst
offender is a 1.4 MB file; a 447 MB one is 9x cheaper per feature). 100 raw
features of one dataset came to 6.4 MB. So the feature ceiling bounds the work
and the byte budget is the real limit -- and it bounds the *read* (`_collect`),
not just the response, so a dataset of enormous geometries cannot be
materialised in full before anything notices.

**Simplification does the work.** At a tolerance of "one screen pixel" the same
100 features came to 0.27 MB -- 24x smaller, and faster, with nothing visible
lost at the zoom the extent is drawn at. It is bounded in both directions:
coarsened while that still pays, and stopped before it empties the shapes it
is thinning.

    deleted. A preview can never outlive the mirror it was sampled under.

    Note the residual: if the harvester rewrites ``data/<id>.parquet`` without
    touching the item's metadata, the digest does not move and the cached
