   soft-deleted item is visible to the space owner/admin only. Returns the rank: 3 owner, 2 editor,
   1 viewer, 0 none; `effective_role` below is the role name over it.

   (rules 6, 6b, 6c). They only ever grant viewer, so a check for editor or more, like "may this
   user share the layer", is the same without them; and rule 6c needs exactly that check for
   another user, which with the derived reads included could come back to rule 6c through that
   user's templates and recurse without end. */
